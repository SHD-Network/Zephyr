# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is supported. Pre-releases are explicitly **not** supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report them to Zephyr team, in the form of a GitHub issue.
However, if you can fix it yourself, fix it yourself first and then propose
a PR at the relevant repository. There is **no** fast track for getting security bugs fixed
urgently. They are still prioritised like other bugs.
