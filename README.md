### [About](https://shd.network/)

Zephyr is a free, open-source, self-hostable prepper platform.

* **Self-hostable** ([Setup Docs](https://github.com/SHD-Network/zephyr/wiki))
* **Open Source** ([GitHub Organization](https://github.com/SHD-Network))
* **Configurable** (Configure every aspect and limits to your needs)
* **Decentralized** (no abuse of power and doesn't have a single point of failure)
* **Extendable** (secure and cross-platform plugin system)
* **Themeable** (cross-platform theme system with design editor)
* **Encrypted** (End to end encryption for secure and private conversation)
* **Secure** (publicly audited and hosted FOSS software for transparent foundation in terms of security)
